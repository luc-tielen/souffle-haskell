 * @brief A Ram Analysis for determining the level of a expression/condition
 *
 * The expression is determined by the TupleElement of an expression/condition
 * with the highest tuple-id number. Note in the implementation we assume that the
 * tuple-id of RamTupleOperation operations are ordered, i.e., the most-outer loop has the
 * smallest tuple-id and the most inner-loop has the largest tuple-id number.
 *
 * If an expression/condition does not contain an TupleElement accessing an element
 * of a tuple, the analysis yields -1 for denoting that the expression/condition
 * can be executed outside of the loop-nest, i.e., the expression/condition is
 * independent of data stemming from relations.
